A melting pot for all kinds of extensions to
[JUnit 5](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5), particular to its Jupiter API.

## A Pioneer's Mission

JUnit Pioneer provides extensions for [JUnit 5](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/) and its Jupiter API.
It does not limit itself to proven ideas with wide application but is purposely open to experiments.
It aims to spin off successful and cohesive portions into sibling projects or back into the JUnit 5 code base.

To enable easy exchange of code with JUnit 5, JUnit Pioneer copies most of its infrastructure, from code style to build tool and configuration to continuous integration.

## Project Structure

### Dependencies

To not add to user's [JAR hell](https://blog.codefx.org/java/jar-hell/), JUnit Pioneer is not taking on any runtime dependencies besides JUnit 5.
Pioneer always depends on the lowest JUnit 5 version that supports its feature set, but that should not keep you from using 5's latest and greatest.

For our own infrastructure, we rely on the following compile and test dependencies:

* JSR-305 (for static analysis)
* AssertJ (assertions for our tests)
* Mockito (mocking for our tests)
* Log4J (to configure logging during test runs)
* Jimfs (as an in-memory file system for our test)

### Code Style

#### `Optional`

[There shall be no null - use `Optional` instead.](https://blog.codefx.org/techniques/intention-revealing-code-java-8-optional/):

* design code to avoid optionality wherever feasibly possible
* in all remaining cases, prefer `Optional` over `null`

#### Assertions

All tests shall use [AssertJ](https://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/)'s assertions and not the ones build into Jupiter:

* more easily discoverable API
* more detailed assertion failures

Yes, use it even if Jupiter's assertions are as good or better (c.f. `assertTrue(bool)` vs `assertThat(bool).isTrue()`) - that will spare us the discussion which assertion to use in a specific case.
