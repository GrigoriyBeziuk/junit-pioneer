:page-description: A drop-in replacement for JUnit 4's @Test annotation, including expected and timeout

The annotation `org.junitpioneer.vintage.@Test` acts as a drop-in replacement for https://junit.org/junit4/javadoc/4.12/org/junit/Test.html[JUnit 4`s `org.junit.@Test` annotation], but marks the method as a regular JUnit Jupiter test.
That means you do not need to run JUnit 5's Vintage engine to execute this test--Jupiter suffices.

Since the test is run by Jupiter, *JUnit 4 runners and rules will have no effect* and you will still have to replace them with JUnit 5 extensions.

Like JUnit 4's version, `@Test` has two optional parameters:

* `expected` to fail a test unless an exception of the specified type is thrown
* `timeout` to fail a test that runs too long (*careful*: at the moment, long running tests are not aborted--they just fail once they're finished)

== Expecting exceptions

The optional parameter `expected` declares that a test method should throw an exception.
If it doesn't throw an exception or if it throws an exception whose type is not the specified one and does not extend it, the test fails.

For example, the following test succeeds because the thrown exception is of the specified type:

[source,java]
----
@Test(expected=IndexOutOfBoundsException.class)
public void outOfBounds_passes() {
	new ArrayList<Object>().get(1);
}
----

This test succeeds because the thrown exception is a subtype of the specified one:

[source,java]
----
@Test(expected=RuntimeException.class)
public void outOfBounds_passes() {
	new ArrayList<Object>().get(1);
}
----

Finally, this test fails because the thrown exception is neither of the specified type nor a subtype:

[source,java]
----
@Test(expected=IllegalArgumentException.class)
public void outOfBounds_fails() {
	new ArrayList<Object>().get(1);
}
----

== Fail long-running tests

The optional parameter `timeout` causes a test to fail if it takes longer than a specified amount of clock time, measured in milliseconds.
The following test fails:

[source,java]
----
@Test(timeout=100)
public void slow_fail() {
	Thread.sleep(1_000);
}
----

Note that unlike in JUnit 4, `timeout` does not abort long-running tests!
The following tests does not fail--it runs indefinitely:

[source,java]
----
@Test(timeout=100)
public void indefinitely() {
	while(true);
}
----
